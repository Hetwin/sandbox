# Sandbox

## Motivation
"Code in the wild" for data science application are the perfect starting point to learn something new. Unfortunately, it is very painful to get the code running especially if you are not familiar with the detailed information about the environment setup.

This issue can be solved by using a development environment running in a Docker container, which is created by a predefined Docker image like [Juypter Stack](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The developer can provide the code and the related development environment. Then you only need to run the code and reproduce the result in an easy way. No time wasting effort anymore!

## Get Docker for Windows
Before you can start, you need to install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). If you are not familiar with the installation of Docker for Windows you can use an installation guide provided on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). 
If you have successfully installed Docker for Windows you can open the PowerShell and insert in the command line

```bash
docker version
```  

If everything works fine, you get detailed information about your Docker version. That’s it! Now you can use the Docker engine.

## Create a Docker container
Again open Windows PowerShell on your windows computer and insert the command line

```bash
whoami
```

With this command, you get your current username. Insert the username on the placeholder position **USER** in the following command line and run the code. The execution will take some time.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v c:/Users/USER/Desktop/work:/home/jovyan/work --name ds -e JUPYTER_TOKEN='easy' jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:2023-06-01
```
Explain the docker commands step by step....

## Navigate to Jupyter Lab
After executing the command line, Jupyter Lab is running in a Docker container. You can navigate to Jupyter Lab with your preferred web browser. Paste the link http://localhost:8888/ and then enter the password “easy”. 

(Insert screen shot)

## Start and Stop container
In this example the docker container is called **ds**. This name is used to start and stop the docker container. Is the container running, you can stop the execution with the following command

```bash
docker container stop ds
```

Vice versa you can start again the docker container with the command 

```bash
docker container start ds
```

Please keep in mind that the name of the docker container should be unique. If you want to **run** the docker container again (do not confuse with start), you have to remove it first or give the new container another unique name. You can remove the container with the command

```bash
docker container rm ds
```

Now you are able to apply your first docker commands and run Jupyter Lab in a docker container. Let's come back to use case from the beginning. 

## Use Case: Jupyter Lab in Docker container
In the following we are using three very popular technologies Docker, Git / GitHub and Jupyter Lab (with Python) to execute a simply python code. The main idea is not only to get a code example but also the related development environment.

### 1. Step: Start a Docker container for Jupyter Lab
Before you can run the example python code you need to start or create a suitable development environment. If the docker container with the Juypter Lab already exists (you can check with the following command).

```bash
docker container list
```

You only need to **start** the container. Otherwise you have to create the docker container with the **run** command.
When Jupyter Lab is successfully running you are ready for the second step.

### 2. Step: Download example pyhton code from GitHub
Now navigate to the folder work and open a Python notebook. **Clone** the GitHub repository sandbox by executing the following command in the opened python notebook.

````python
! git clone https://github.com/Hetwin/sandbox.git
````

In the listed folder of Jupyter Lab appears the folder sandbox. Moreover you can also find this folder on your Desktop in the folder work, which is the same folder as in the Jupyter Lab. Finally delete the opend Python notebook.

### 3. Step: Execute the example python code
In the last step you can open and execute the python file simple_example_keras.ipynb in the same development environment, in which it was developed. That's it. This is the genius idea behind a complete repoduceable code without any effort.
